            <p id="innerAbout">Welcome to Premier Pokémon Rentals, a prestigious establishment with a legacy that spans over a century! Our founder, Colin Blissey, has a story as extraordinary as the Pokémon we offer. Abandoned as a child and raised by a nurturing Blissey in the wild, Colin's deep bond with Pokémon began early in life. To honor the Pokémon who raised him and shaped his character, Colin adopted the Blissey name as his own, a symbol of his enduring love and respect for these incredible creatures.
